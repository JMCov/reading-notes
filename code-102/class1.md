# Markdown

Markdown is a powerful tool that is incredibly powerful and yet the basic syntax is easy to learn. Markdown makes formatting a website easy.

Some of the stylized text options I have learned are:

- Typing `**Bold**` will make the words in between the asterisks Bold
  - Ex.   **Bold**
- Typing `*Italic*` will make the words in between the asterisks Italicized
  - Ex. *Italic*
- You can combine them by typing `***Bold and Italicized***`  
  - Ex. ***Bold and Italicized***

For the newer generations there are even emoji options

- Typing a colon and a letter will present you with a list of emojis to search through. 
  - For instance Typing `:cat` will present you a list of emjois with cat in the title and you can select any you want.
    - Ex. ðŸ˜¾


## Things I want to know more about

I would like to know how to format columns on the pages similar to a newspaper.
