# Markdown

Markdown is a powerful tool that is incredibly powerful and yet the basic syntax is easy to learn. Markdown makes formatting a website easy.

Some of the stylized text options I have learned are:

- Typing `**Bold**` will make the words in between the asterisks Bold
  - Ex.   **Bold**
- Typing `*Italic*` will make the words in between the asterisks Italicized
  - Ex. *Italic*
- You can combine them by typing `***Bold and Italicized***`  
  - Ex. ***Bold and Italicized***

For the newer generations there are even emoji options

- Typing a colon and a letter will present you with a list of emojis to search through.
  - For instance Typing `:cat` will present you a list of emjois with cat in the title and you can select any you want.
    - Ex. ðŸ˜¾

 To me a growth mindset is the ability to expand your mind no matter the obstacles in your way. To absorb all data given to you positive or negative and turn it into something that allows you to grow.

## **Three Reminders to maintain a growth mindset**

- You can't make an omelette without cracking some eggs.
- You can learn anything if you dedicate time to it.
- Criticism can be a more powerful ally than praise.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to know how to format columns on the pages similar to a newspaper.
