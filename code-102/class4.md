# Wireframes and HTML

## Wireframes

**Wireframes** are an essential tool to web development. A wireframe is a visual representation of how your website will roughly look like. You draw a basic outline and annotate where graphics, text, audio, etc. goes. Next you do a flowchart of how the links and text should work and write what the code should look like based off your wireframe design.  When it comes time to code in HTML the work is basically done as you have an idea of how everything should work.

It is important to not over complicate the wireframe as it is intended to be a rough draft.

## HTML

**HTML** or **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage is the basic building block to websites. It defines the meaning and the structure of web content

HTML consists of a series of elements to create content. Elements consist of:

- **Tags** - Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags define the name of the element. For instance, `<header>` is the opening tag for what the header of your website will display. The closing tag is annotated `</header>`.

- **Content** - In between the opening and closing tags is where the content of the element resides.  For instance, `<header>Google</header>` would display the word Google at the top of the webpage.

Elements have to be nested properly to work.  If another element's closing tag is before the closing tag of an element it is nested in it will not work. Example:

1. `<p><strong>Hello World!</strong></p>`
2. `<p><strong>Hello World!</p></strong>`

Example 1 would work properly, however Example 2 would not run because the closing tags are not in proper order.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to learn about more element/tag names so I can utilize HTML to the fullest extent
