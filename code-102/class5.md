# CSS

**CSS** stands for Cascading Style Sheets and allows for your websites to look much better than if you just wrote them in HTML alone. It is a rule based language where you define the rules by specifying the styles that should be applied to certian HTML elements.

Example: `hl {color: purple;}`

This line of CSS would change the text in level one headings to purple. CSS allows for multiple rules within the braces.  You can change text and backgroup color at the same time. 

There are 3 ways to add CSS:

- **External CSS** - the CSS is done in a seperate file and is referenced on the HTML file
- **Internal CSS** - the CSS is implemented within the HTML file with the `<style>` element being used
- **Inline CSS** - Used mainly if you want a single element to have a certain style. This is typically regarded as a bad practice.

If you use all 3 methods then the priority of style being used will be Inline, External/Internal, and then browser default.

## Color

There are multiple ways to select different colors in CSS.  Some common ways are:

**HEX Value** - `body{color: #24AC87;}`
**RGB Value** - `body{color: rgb(130, 40, 123);}`
**Typing a color** - `body{color: blue;}`

## Things I want to know more about

I need to learn more about positioning sections on my website and how to have text move exactly where I want it around links and images.
