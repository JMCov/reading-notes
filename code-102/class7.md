# Programming with JavaScript

**Control Flow** is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code runs in order from the first line to the last unless it runs into structures that change the control of flow like loops and functions.

**Function Syntax** is defined by the function keyword, name and then a pair of parenthesis where parameters are filled.

Functions are used so the developer does not have to reuse code. For instance, you can write a function to convert the US dollar into foreign currency. You would have your function except user input of a dollar amount, do the math of the conversion rates inside the function, and finally have the function return the value.

**Operators** tell the code what you want it to do.  There are many operators from:

- `=`   assignment operator which gives a variable the assigned value of whatever the program wants
- `++`  increment operator which adds 1 to the variable
- `*`   multiplication operator telling the program to multiply variables
- `==`  equal to comparision operator which is used to see if 2 things are equal to each other
- `!=`  not equal operator which determines if 2 things are not equal to each other

**Expressions** are valid units of code that resolve a value. There are 2 types of expressions

- Those that have side effects such as assigning values
- Those that evaluate

`x = 124` is an expression with a side effect by assigning the value of 124 to x, and
`22 * 2` is the the type of expression that evaluates the math

All expressions are joined by operators which come in different types below are a few of the types:

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- BigInt operators
- String operators

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to reserarch more operators to see what JavaScript has to offer.
