# Operators and Loops

**Expressions** are valid units of code that resolve a value. There are 2 types of expressions

**Operators** tell the code what you want it to do.  There are many operators from:

Operators require operands to work.  

- Ex. `x + y`

In this example x and y are the operands and the + is the operator. Some operators ony require 1 operand like the following example:

- Ex `x++`

In this example x is the operand and the ++ is a postfix unary operator. ++ and -- are the only unary operators in JavaScript.

## Assignment operator

An **Assignment operator** assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. `x = f()` This example assigns x the value of what the function returns.

Assignment operators also have shorthand to make coding quicker. For instance, `x += y` really means `x = x + y`, you can do this with many assignment operators another example being `x *= y` is the same as `x = x * y`

## Comparison operator

A **Comparison operator** is an operator that compares its operands and returns a value based on whether the comparison is true.

A few comparison operators are:

- `==` means equal. It returns true if the operands are equal.
- `!=` means not equal which returns true if the operands are not equal.
- `!==` means strict not equal, this returns true if the operands are the sasme type but not equal or are of a different type.

## Loops

**Loops** are a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. There are several different types of loops including:

- While Loop
- For statement
- do...While

They each offer different ways to do a loop and each has its time and place.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to know more about loops in JavaScript. Particularly breaks and switches.
