# Debugging

**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

1. **Syntax errors**: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

2. **Logic errors**: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

From [Syntax Errors & Logic Errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

A variable came back as undefined. It was because I was trying to remove a table element but was calling it wrong. I had to give the element an Id to remove it properly.

**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

Debugging is something every developer goes through. No one is perfect and small mistakes as little as a slash or period can completely break code. I will need to understand many ways to properly debug so my websites can work properly

**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

The first thing that came to mind while thinking of a way to describe it to a non-technical person is a police detective reviewing a video tape to get evidence. They would slow the video down to determine exactly what is happening to pinpoint who/what is at fault.

**Define what a breakpoint is.**

Breakpoints are places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly

**What is the call stack?**

The call stack shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.

## Things I want to know more about

Debugging methods are always sought after by me. It is vital to find quick ways to identify a problem so you can continue coding. I would like to know more about the debugging tool.
