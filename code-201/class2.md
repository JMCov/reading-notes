# Basics of HTML, CSS and JS

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are some of the basic foundations of creating websites. They are the core of what makes the internet.

## HTML

**Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**

It gives the text meaning so that the browser knows how to display it correctly.

**How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**

There are six heading elements: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>`

**What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?**

`<sup>` and `<sub>` stand for superscript and subscript.  They are used for dates, chemical formulae and mathematical equations.

**When using the `<abbr>` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**

The title attribute must be used. Example:

`<abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr>`

## CSS

**What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?**

1. **External Stylesheet** - A separate file with a `.css` extension.

2. **Internal Style Sheet** - Resides within an HTML document. You place the CSS inside a `<style>` elemen inside the HTML `<head>`.

3. **Inline Style** - Declarations that affect a single HTML element contained within a `<style>` attribute.

**Why should we avoid using inline styles?**

It is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. It also mixes CSS with HTML making everything hard to read.

**Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:**
**What is representing the selector?**

h2

**Which components are the CSS declarations?**

color:black;
padding: 5px;

**Which components are considered properties?**

Color & padding

## JavaScript

**What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?**

String

**List 4 types of JavaScript operators.**

- Addition
- Assignment
- Strict Equality
- Not / Does not equal

**Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.**

If it is 6:00AM have my coffee pot make a pot of coffee automatically.

**An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.**

Logical Operator / True

**What is the use of an else if?**

It is used incase an if statement needs to have multiple choices/outcomes

**List 3 different types of comparison operators.**

1. `===` tests if one value is identical to another
2. `<` and `>` tests if one value is less than or greater than another
3. `!==` tests if a value is not identical to another
4. `<=` tests if a value is less than or equal to

**What is the difference between the logical operator `&&` and `||`?**

`&&` — **AND** - allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.

`||` — **OR** - allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that one or more of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
