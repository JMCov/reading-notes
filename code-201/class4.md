# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## HTML

**To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**

Inside a `<a>` element and using the `href` attribute.

**The `href` attribute contains what information?**

It contains the web address for the link you want.

**What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**

To make the link title easier to read and understand.

## CSS

**What is meant by “normal flow”?**

The way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.

**What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements?**

- **Inline elements** size is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements,they just sit inside the content of block level elements, except for images.

- **Block level** element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content.

**___ positioning is the default for every html element.**

Static Positioning

**Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**

With **absolute positioning** you can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example, popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page

**What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**

**Absolute positioning** fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), **fixed** positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

## JavaScript

**Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**

**Function declaration** is the process of defining what the function is and does. **Function Invocation** is the process of calling a function for use. It will have the function name with a pair of parentheses with parameters sometimes inside.

**What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**

**Parameters** are sometimes called **arguments** and need to be specified when you are invoking a function, these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses

**Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

1. Pair programming is useful for efficiency.  Having one person code and another looking up documentation makes completion of the job quicker.

2. Pair programming is also useful for collaboration.  Two minds are better than one and each perrson can come up with unique ideas that the other hadn't thought of, leading to a more innovative process.

## Things I want to learn more about

I would like to try pair programming.  It's easy to see its usefuless but I would like to see it in real world use.
