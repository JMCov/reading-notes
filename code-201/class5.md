# Images, Color, Text

## HTML

**What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?**

If someone is visually impaired the `alt` attribute could read out load what the picture is.

**How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**

You can write captions under the image to describe what the picture is showing. Also by using the `alt` attribute you it will tell you what the picture should be if it fails to load.

**Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.**

If you have multiple pictures and want to add a caption to each you can wrap your `<img>` with a `<figure>` element to define the caption for specific pictures using the `<figcaption>` element inside `<figure>`

**Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**

GIFs and SVGs are both used to show short animations.  The main differnece is that SVG files will look better and not as pixelated as most GIFs.

**What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**

I would probably use a `png` because it uses lossless compression and supports higher color depths

## CSS

**Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**

The foreground color would be like a picture in a frame.  Sometimes picture frames have a border around the picture.  This border would be the background color and the foreground would be the picture itself.

**Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**

I would probably go to Adobe's website with their color wheel and find a good color scheme that matches the theme of the website. For instance if it is a blog about woodworking I would probably look for a scheme that has browns and other darker colors to get the feel you are in a woodworking shop.

**What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**

To make sure your font is a **web safe font**. This means the font is available on all operating systems.

**What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?**

- **font-size** Determines the size of your text.

- **font-style** Used to turn italic text on or off.

- **font-weight** Sets how bold the text is.

**Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.**

You could use the `word-spacing` and `letter-spacing` properties to space the chaaracters displayed.

## Things I want to know more about

I need to continue to read more about CSS. I am getting better at it!
