# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

**How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**

An object is a collection of related data. It could be explained like a Swiss Army knife.  It has other tools inside the entire object of Swiss Army knife. SwissArmyKnife.Scissors or SwissArmyKnife.ScrewDriver would be examples to call methods of the object.

**What are some advantages to creating object literals?**

You get to put exactly what data you want inside the object.  It makes it eaasier to transfer data by sending an one object versus all the data inside the object individually.

**How do objects differ from arrays?**

Instead of calling using a piece of data's index number to call it in an array, an object can use the name associated with of the value.

**Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.**

If an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation

**Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?**

**This** refers to the current object the code is being written inside. It is useful when using constructors to create more than one object from a single object definition

**What is the DOM?**

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

**Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.**

The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.

## Things I want to know more about

I woud like to understand the relationship between DOM and JavaScript better.
