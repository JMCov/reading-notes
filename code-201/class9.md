## HTML Forms

**Why are forms so important in web development?**

It is one of the main ways that a user interacts with a webpage by inputinning data for processing or storage.

**When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?**

- Do not make the form too long as it may frustrate the user.

- Do not include a form reset function unless necessary

**List 5 form elements and explain their importance.**

1. `<form>` - How all forms start. This initializes a form.

2. `<label>` - The "title" for data entry portions of the form.

3. `<input>` - This determines what type of input the user will be using.  If set to `type="text"` then the user will input some form of text in this field of the form.

4. `<textarea>` - The input area for the user that can be a multiline text field.

5. `<button>` - Creates an interactive object for the user to click. Commonly used as a `submit` button at the bottom of a form.

## JavaScript

**How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?**

A non technical example of what an event is would be if you are checking out at the grocery store in self checkout. When you click Pay/Checkout it creates an event letting the system know you are done with your order and to fire the message to the system to allow payment options.

**When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?**

The name of the event and a function to handle the event.

**Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?**

Inside an event handler function parameters, called event objects, are automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features/information.

**What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?**

1. **Event Bubbling** - Describes how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements.

2. **Event Capturing** - The same as bubbling but the order is reversed.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know if forms can be used to process large amounts of data for a side project I am going to try to make.
