## nosql vs sql

**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
- SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.
- SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
- SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
- SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

## sql vs nosql (Video)

**What does SQL stand for?**

Structured Query Language

**What is a relational database?**

Separate databases that connect together.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

tables, rows, and columns

**What is a ‘schema’?**

A database schema defines how data is organized within a relational database

**What is a NoSQL database?**

non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables

**How does it work?**

It uses collections instead of tables. These collections have documents that can be different in each field of the database (no Schema).

**What is inside of a MongoDB database?**

Collections of documents

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

MongoDB because it doesn't adhere to a schema

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

Not having a schema can be a disadvantage for NoSQL if you need to have strict fields for your database.
