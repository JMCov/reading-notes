## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API (Watch a Twitch streamer code an Express API in 20 minutes!)

Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

REST is an architectural system centered around resources and Hypermedia using HTTP commands. CRUD is a cycle meant to maintain records in a database setting. In its base form, CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

- Client - Server relationship
- Stateless client-server communication, no client information is stored between get requests
- Cacheable data that streamlines client-server interactions
- Uniform interface between components
- Layered system that organizes each type of server
