**Who is Roy Fielding?**

He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

Older computers weren't designed to talk to all machines in the world, they were created to only talk within a small group.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

HTTP, the protocal that helps browser know where to go when a user types a website URL after it.

**What does a GET do?**

retrieves the website you entered in the URL

**What does a POST do?**

If one system needs to add something to another system it would use an HTTP verb of POST
