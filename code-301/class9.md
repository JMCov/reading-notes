# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

**What is functional programming?**

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

From [Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

**What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects

**What are the benefits of a pure function?**

The code is easier to test.

**What is immutability?**

Data thats state cannot change after it’s created

**What is Referential transparency?**

If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent


## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

**What is a module?**

Splitting code into different pieces to where you have a module that does a certain thing and you call upon it whenever you need it

**What does the word ‘require’ do?**

It allows a JS file to access another JS module

**How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

By using require(./"File_Name) in the file you are bringing the module into and using module.exports = "Function Name" in the module that is being used.
