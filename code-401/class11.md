# Event Driven Applications

## Event Driven Programming

**What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**

EventEmitter

**What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**

By registering event listeners we can actually reverse the flow of communication between our objects. Rather than on object needing to reach inside another object to trigger a function, our objects can just emit events and whichever objects are listening to those event will process it in the way they have been told to. The source of an objects behavior is now entirely contained within itself, rather than needing to be accessed by external objects.

From [Event-Driven Programming in Node.js](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

**Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**

It could be useful so when an event is triggered which ever objects are listening to will process

## Additional Questions

Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

Event Driven Programming seem to be something that will be very useful so I want to learn more about that.

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

How events can be used in SQL databases.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to learn how we can do more with events and ddatabases.
