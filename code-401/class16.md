# AWS: Cloud Servers

## AWS EC2

**What is an EC2 Instance?**

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers the broadest and deepest compute platform, with over 500 instances and choice of the latest processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model to help you best match the needs of your workload. We are the first major cloud provider that supports Intel, AMD, and Arm processors, the only cloud with on-demand EC2 Mac instances, and the only cloud with 400 Gbps Ethernet networking. We offer the best price performance for machine learning training, as well as the lowest cost per inference instances in the cloud. More SAP, high performance computing (HPC), ML, and Windows workloads run on AWS than any other cloud.

**Name 2 use cases for EC2.**

1. Run cloud native and enterprise applications
2. Scale for HPC applications


## EC2 For Humans

**Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?**

Under the compute section

**Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.**

T2 micro - 1 vCPU, 1 GB of RAM
T2 XL -  4 vCPUs, 32 GB of RAM

**Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.**

It is how a computers CPU recieves instructions, determines what they are and performs the task.

## Elastic Beanstalk

**What is Elastic Beanstalk?**

A service that deploys, manages and scales web apps and service for you.

**Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.**

When you create a web server environment, AWS Elastic Beanstalk creates one or more  EC2 virtual machines. The instances in your environment are configured to run web apps on the platform that you choose.

**Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.**

- You don't have to manage or configure infrastructure

- Automatically load balances

- Only pay for AWS resources so Elastic Beanstalk is free after that

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to learn more about how AWS works and how I can use it in future projects.
