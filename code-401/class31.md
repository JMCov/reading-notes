# Context API

## Choosing the State Structure

**Summarize the five principles for structuring state.**

The 5 principles state that related state variables should be merged, contradictions and redundancies should be avoided, duplication should be reduced, and deeply nested state should be avoided. By following these guidelines, you can make your code more efficient and easier to manage.

## Passing State Deeply with Context

**What problem do Contexts aim to solve?**

Passing props through a large heirarchy

**What is one technique to try before useContext?**

Start with passing props normally if there is not a lot of components.

**What hook complements useContext for complex applications?**

Reducer

## Things I want to know more about

Reading about useCOntext makes me think that some of my previous projects could have been coded a lot more easy than they were. I will like to see this in implementation.
