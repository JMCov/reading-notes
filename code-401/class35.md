# Graphs

Graph - a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

Undirected Graph - a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

Directed Graph (Digraph) - a graph where every edge is directed.

Complete Graph - when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

Connected Graph - graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

Disconnected Graph - a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

Acyclic Graph - a directed graph without cycles.

Cycle - when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

Cyclic Graph - a graph that has cycles.

Adjacency matrix - represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix.

Sparse Graph - when there are very few connections.

Dense Graph - when there are many connections.

Adjacency List - a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

Weighted Graph - a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.
