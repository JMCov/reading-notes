# Project Ideas

1. A planetary database that holds records and data of celestial objects User's can input exoplanets with appropriate rights.

2. Naughty or Nice list for Santa! Holds a database for kids around the world with their wishlist and whether they are naughty or nice. Obviously the Santa Role is required to be able to make the decision of coal or presents.

## Things I want to know more about

I hope this project will help me understand ACLs and databases more.  I think  I am begginging to grasp it.
