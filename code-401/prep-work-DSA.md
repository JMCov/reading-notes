# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

You should considered what the desired outcome is. Each data structure is good at doing particular things so determining what the end goal is should help determine which data structure should be used.

2.How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

Use a base case and a recursive case. This will ensure that the function will end.

## Things I want to know more about

I need to learn more about linked lists and search trees. They can both get complicated.
