# SQL

In the SQL Lessons we learned how to run query searches to find specific rows and columns of data using unique conditions. Not only could we search for specific criteria but we also learned how to structure the data given back to us by omiting certain columns, rows, and by ordering them by ascending or descending order. We then learned database management and were taught how to add, update, and delete rows and columns. Finally we were taught how to add, join and delete entire tables.
