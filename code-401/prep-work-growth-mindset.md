# Growth Mindset

Practicing deliberately will help your mind grow and improve your coding skills. The biggest takeaway for me from this article were the key ideas behind deliberate practice which are:

- Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
- Repeated often
- Feedback on results in continuously available
- It's highly demanding mentally
- It's difficult
- It requires good goals

The first 2 in my opinion are the most important and I always strive to do this.

The topic Growth Mindset in the videos showed that high IQ doesn't always mean you will do good in school or learning in general.  Having grit and motivation to get through a subject is how you achieve success. Having a growth mindset is a way of viewing challenges and failures. How you handle either of these things can effect how you will learn.  Basically failing and getting back up to understand you will eventually succeed is a view of a growth mindset.

## Things I want to know more about

I'm not really sure what else I want to know about the growth mindset since this is the 4th time doing an assignment on it. I get it.
